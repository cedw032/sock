# sock
This was orginally intended to be a working socket server but grew into a webRTC prototype.

It was built primarily with reference two these two resources:
- https://socket.io/get-started/chat/
- https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/pc1/

Some work was required to achieve establishing a peer connection with another computer.
The result can be viewed here: https://warm-brook-34037.herokuapp.com

Limited success.  Works when run on chrome on a mac connecting to chrome on a galaxy s9 on the same wifi.
